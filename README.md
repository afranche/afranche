# Hello There!

My name is Anouar. I'm a full-stack software engineer turned AppSec Engineer
with over 5 years of experience now. You may find me posting little projects
here and there, and contributing to projects where my skills are helping !

Outside of work, I'm currently focused on building [Posture][posture] and
building [Crossbone][crossbone], a non-profit organization to entertain a
local community and host events like talks or meetups around software and
cloud engineering. Finally but not least, I love producing music and race
cars. So here and then you might see me overshare on such topics. ☕

For a more detailed view of my skills, head over to my [LinkedIn][linkedin].

## Projects

- 📦 [Palette](#), an experimental package manager for learning purposes (repository unavailable atm).
- 🏎️ [My MX-8](#), the project car which I'm swapping a V6 engine in.

# Hello There!

My name is Anouar. I'm a DevSecOps Engineer, with experience in both software
engineering and cybersecurity ! You may find me posting little projects here
and there for fun on my Github. I'm currently focused on building [Posture][posture].

Last but not least, I love producing music and race cars. ☕ 

For a more detailed view of my skills, head over to my [LinkedIn][linkedin].

- 📦 [Posture][posture], a very early-stage security defect manager for appsec.
- 🏎️ [My MX-8](#), a very, not-alive, RX-8 with a V6 engine.
